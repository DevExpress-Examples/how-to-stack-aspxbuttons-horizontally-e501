# How to stack ASPxButtons horizontally


<p>The ASPxButton is rendered as a HTML table to support extended visual appearances such as borders, highlighting, gradients, etc. Two HTML tables cannot be placed side-by-side without using an auxiliary table. This example demonstrates two solutions for stacking buttons horizontally:<br />
1. The buttons are placed into neighbor cells of an additional HTML table's row.<br />
2. Native rendering is enabled for the ASPxButton control, so that the buttons are rendered as <input> rather than <table>.<br />
Both solutions are also applicable to other controls from the ASPxEditors control collection.</p><p>We recommend that you use the first solution of these two.</p>
